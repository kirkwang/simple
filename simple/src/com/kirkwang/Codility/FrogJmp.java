 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Write a function:
 * <p>
 * int solution(int X, int Y, int D);
 * <p>
 * that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a
 * position equal to or greater than Y.
 * <p>
 * For example, given: X = 10 Y = 85 D = 30
 * <p>
 * the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:
 * <p>
 * after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40 after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 =
 * 70 after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100
 * <p>
 * Assume that:
 * <p>
 * X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000]; X â‰¤ Y.
 * <p>
 * Complexity:
 * <p>
 * expected worst-case time complexity is O(1); expected worst-case space complexity is O(1).
