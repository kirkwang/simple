/**
 * Created by kewang on 11/8/17.

 * https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/3-time_complexity/frog_jmp/
 *
 *
 * Write a function:
 *
 * int solution(int X, int Y, int D);
 *
 * that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a
 * position equal to or greater than Y.
 *
 * For example, given: X = 10 Y = 85 D = 30
 *
 * the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:
 *
 * after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40 after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 =
 * 70 after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100
 *
 * Assume that:
 *
 * X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000]; X â‰¤ Y.
 *
 * Complexity:
 *
 * expected worst-case time complexity is O(1); expected worst-case space complexity is O(1).
